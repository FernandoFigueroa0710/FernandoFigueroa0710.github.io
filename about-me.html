    <div class="goals">
      <p>My name is Fernando Adan Figueroa Abarca; I was born in Mexico City,
      I moved to the United States at at very early age, I moved first to California
      where I still have lots of family -my family is settled in the bay area, San Francisco
      Redwood City and San Jose.</p>
      <br>
      <br>

      <p>Later on we moved to Detroit, MI to where I spent most of my chilhood, early years
      living at first in the Southwest Detroit area known as "Mexican Town" and later on
      moving to the suburb of Redford; where I lived until I attended college.</p>
<br>
<br>
      <p>I started to work at an early age as well (16) to not only pay for my own things butto
      to also help with the family expenses -My Dad always tried to teach me the sense of
      sense of responsability and the concept of being a man.</p>
<br>
<br>
      <p>I worked numerous jobs, back then it was landscaping and also construction the big
      money makers; so I did that; later on I found one of my passions in the restaurant business
    where I stared as a dishwasher and four years later I held the position of AGM in a corporate
  chain of restaurants where I learned a lot about not only cooking but also about leadership
and people skills</p>
